#Define which sounds generate cues for mobs to detect, followed by their size. Use *snippet to select all sounds that include the snippet in their full name. The list is processed top-down, so putting *tags first will allow you to override specific ones later. Shouting disregards this and always generates a sound cue of the defined radius, regardless of which sound clients have it set as.
